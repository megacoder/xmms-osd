# XMMS-OSD

The XOSD tool used to come with an XMMMS plugin to display the current song info.  Then the GNOME developers decided they had too many users and invented Gnome3 to discard everything done up to date.  I finally got so irratated that I wrote this little beastie.  Doesn't need any plugin help from XMMS, it is linked against the API library.
